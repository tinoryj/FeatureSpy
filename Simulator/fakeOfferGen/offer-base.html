 <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" align="right"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Exhibit 10.1 </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">June 6, 2008 </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Patrick Pichette </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><u>Re: Offer of
Employment with Google Inc. </u></font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Dear Patrick: </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On behalf of
Google Inc., I am pleased to offer you the exempt position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, subject to the terms and contingencies set forth below. The position is located in Mountain
View, California. Your start date shall be August&nbsp;1, 2008 and you will assume the position of CFO effective August&nbsp;12, 2008. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">You will receive an
annual salary of $450,000, which will be paid biweekly and subject to a periodic review. You are eligible to participate in the Company Bonus Program; your annual bonus target will be 150% of base salary. Bonuses under the Company Bonus Plan are
discretionary. The actual bonus amount could be larger or smaller than this amount, based on your performance and the performance of the Company. Whether a bonus will be awarded in a particular bonus period, and in what amount, is within
Google�s sole discretion. Both your base salary and the components of your bonus are subject to periodic review. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Additionally, upon your start date,
Google will pay you a one-time Sign-On Bonus of $300,000. This will be taxed as supplemental income. At the completion of six months of full-time employment with us, Google will pay you an additional $500,000 Cash Bonus. This will also be taxed as
supplemental income. In the event your employment is terminated within the first six months of your employment, the Cash Bonus payout will be accelerated and paid on the termination date or as soon thereafter as Company business practices allow, but
in any case within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of your termination. If you terminate your employment at Google before the one year anniversary of your start date, other than as a result of a breach by Google of this Agreement, you will be required to
repay the Sign-On Bonus and Cash Bonus. Any required repayment will be prorated based on the number of remaining calendar days until the one year anniversary of your start date. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Google will pay relocation costs and provide reimbursement for specified moving expenses as outlined in Google's North American Officer Relocation Policy. In order to receive these benefits, you will be required
to work with a third party vendor provider designated by Google to assist in employee moves. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">As a regular full-time employee you will be eligible for
various benefits offered to similarly-situated Google employees in accordance with the terms of Google's policies and benefit plans. Among other things, these benefits currently include medical and dental insurance, life insurance, and a 401(k)
retirement plan. You will automatically be enrolled in the 401(k) plan at 4% into the Wellesley Fund, which is a balanced fund of stocks and bonds. You will be able to change your deferral amount and fund allocation upon your hire. The eligibility
requirements and other information regarding these benefits are set forth in </font>

Your GSUs will vest at a rate of 100 percent at twelve months. At that time, the vested number of GSUs will convert to a
number of Google Class&nbsp;A common shares.

representation about the future value of the stock options or GSUs granted herein and you should expect that the value of these grants will fluctuate in the future. Finally, the receipt of such grants shall be conditioned upon the subsequent
execution by the grantee of Google's appropriate form of GSU and Stock Option grant agreement. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">For annual equity grants awarded in 2009 and
thereafter, your grants will be reviewed pursuant to the same general process employed for all Executives of comparable status. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We encourage you to
