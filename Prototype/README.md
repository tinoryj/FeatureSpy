# FeatureSpy prototype

## Prerequisites

FeatureSpy is tested on a machine that equips with a Gigabyte B460M-DS3H motherboard and an Intel i7-10700 CPU and runs Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

Before running FeatureSpy, check if your machine supports SGX. If there is an option such as `SGX` or `Intel Software Guard Extensions` in BIOS, then enable the option; otherwise, your machine does not support SGX. We strongly recommend finding the SGX-supported device in the [SGX hardware list](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware).

### Registration

FeatureSpy uses EPID-based remote attestation, and you need to register at the [EPID attestation page](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation). Then, you can find your SPID and the corresponding subscription keys (both the primary and the secondary keys) on the [products page](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/products). Our test uses the `DEV Intel® Software Guard Extensions Attestation Service (Unlinkable)` product.


### Dependencies

FeatureSpy depends on the following packages that need to be installed manually or by package management tools.

1. Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) driver version 2.11.0_2d2b795 [Download Link](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.11.0_2d2b795.bin)
2. Intel® SGX SDK version 2.15.101.1 [Download Link](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.15.101.1.bin)
3. Intel® SGX SSL version lin_2.15.1_1.1.1l [Download Link](https://github.com/intel/intel-sgx-ssl/archive/refs/tags/lin_2.15.1_1.1.1l.zip)
4. OpenSSL version 1.1.1l [Donwload Link](https://www.openssl.org/source/old/1.1.1/openssl-1.1.1l.tar.gz)
5. SGX packages including `libsgx-epid` `libsgx-quote-ex` `libsgx-dcap-ql` `ibsgx-urts` `libsgx-launch` `libsgx-enclave-common-dev` `libsgx-uae-service`... etc. (See SGX Installation Guide [Download Link](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf) for detail).
6. libssl-dev (For FeatureSpy encryption algorithm)
7. libboost-all-dev (For FeatureSpy multithreading, message transmission, etc.)
8. libleveldb-dev (For FeatureSpy deduplication index based on LevelDB)
9. libsnappy-dev (Required by LevelDB)
10. build-essential (Basic program compilation environment)
11. cmake (CMake automated build framework)
12. wget (System components used for remote attestation requests)

We now provide a **one-step script** to automatically install and configure the dependencies. We have tested the script on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. Note that the script will ask for a password for sudo operations if necessary.

```shell
chmod +x scripts/environmentInstall.sh
./scripts/environmentInstall.sh
```

Restart is required after the installation is finished. Then, check whether `sgx_enclave` and `sgx_provision` are in `/dev`. If it is not in the directory (i.e., the SGX driver is not successfully installed), reinstall the SGX driver manually and restart the machine until `sgx_enclave` and `sgx_provision` are in `/dev`. We strongly recommend that you refer to the instructions of [SGX Installation Guide: Download Link](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf) and [SGX SSL README: Link](https://github.com/intel/intel-sgx-ssl) during manual or automatic installation for troubleshooting.

## FeatureSpy Running Guide

### Configuration

FeatureSpy is configured based on JSON. You can change its configuration without rebuilding it. We show the default configuration (`./config.json`) of FeatureSpy as follows.

```json
{
    "ChunkerConfig": {
        "_chunkingType": "VariableSize", // FixedSize: fixed size chunking; VariableSize: variable size chunking; TraceFSL: FSL dataset hash list; TraceMS: MS dataset hash list

    }
}
```

Currently, we provide a set of Intel EPID-based remote attestation subscription keys for testing in `./Prototype/config.json`. However, the embedded certificate may be invalid due to Intel's certificate authority mechanism. At this time, please refer to the registration section to register from the official website of Intel and refer to this document to set the `SPID`, `_PriSubscriptionKey`, and `_SecSubscriptionKey`.

If you need to adjust FeatureSpy's detection indicator length (L), window size (W), and threshold (T), please modify the values of the following parameters in the `./Prototype/include/systemSettings.hpp` file.

```c++
...
/* FeatureSpy Settings */
#define INDICATOR_LENGTH 32 // Default to 2 encryption blocks
#define PREFIX_FREQUENCY_THRESHOLD 160 // Here is the frequency threshold value (T*W), default to 0.01*16000=160
#define COUNT_WINDOW_SIZE 16000 // Default window size W = 16K
...
```

### Build

Compile FeatureSpy as follows.

```shell
mkdir -p bin && mkdir -p build && mkdir -p lib && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make

cd ..
cp lib/*.a bin/
cp ./lib/pow_enclave.signed.so ./bin
cp ./lib/km_enclave.signed.so ./bin
cp config.json bin/
cp -r key/ bin/
mkdir -p bin/Containers && mkdir -p bin/Recipes
```

Alternatively, we provide a script for a quick build and clean-up, and you can use it.

```shell
chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
# Build FeatureSpy in release mode
./scripts/buildPrototype.sh
# Clean up build result
./scripts/cleanupPrototype.sh
```

Note that the generated executable file and its required enclave dynamic library, keys, etc., are all stored in the `bin` directory.

### Usage

You can test FeatureSpy in a single machine and connect the key manager, server, and client instances via the local loopback interface in `bin` directory. Note that here you need multiple console windows or tabs to start the key server, cloud and client respectively. 

```shell
# start cloud
cd bin
./server-sgx

# start key manager
cd bin
./keymanager-sgx
```

Since the key enclave needs to be attested by the cloud before usage, you need to start the cloud (`server-sgx`) first, then start the key manager (`keymanager-sgx`), and wait for the message `KeyServerMain : key server remote attestation done, start to provide service` that indicates a successful attestation.

FeatureSpy automatically verifies the client enclave by remote attestation in the first startup of the client and by unsealing in the following startups. FeatureSpy provides stores and restores interfaces to clients.

```shell
# store file
cd bin
./client-sgx -s file

# restore file
cd bin
./client-sgx -r file
```

Note that we do not provide any command-line interface for renewing the blinded key. Instead, you can configure `KeyServerConfig._keyRegressionIntervals` and `server._raSessionKeylifeSpan` (in the unit of a second) in `config.json` to set the periods for the key renewing cycle in the key manager and the cloud, respectively. Also, you can configure `_keyRegressionMaxTimes` to control the maximum number of key regressions (2^20 by default).
