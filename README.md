# FeatureSpy: Detecting Learning-Content Attacks via Feature Inspection in Secure Deduplicated Storage

## Introduction

FeatureSpy is a secure deduplicated storage system that effectively detects learning-content attacks based on the observation that such attacks often generate a large volume of similar data.

This repo contains the implementation of the FeatureSpy prototype and a trace analysis tool used in our IEEE INFOCOM 2023 paper.

* **./Prototype**: includes the implementation of the prototype.
* **./Simulator**: includes a trace analysis tool to measure the detection and false-positive rate of FeatureSpy.

Note that each folder has a separate README file to introduce the detailed build and usage instructions.

## Simulator

Our paper uses the simulator to run the experiments in Â§VI.B. It includes `SyntheticSnapshots` and `CaseStudy` used for both Exp#1 and Exp#2, respectively. Note that it may take more than a week to run the test according to the same settings as the paper. So we simplified the test script, and the simple test can be completed in a few minutes by referring to this README. If you need a full test, please refer to xx.

### Dependencies

FeatureSpy simulator is developed under Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. It depends on the following packages that need to be installed by the default `apt` and `pip` package management tools.

```shell
sudo apt install -y build-essential openssl libssl-dev clang llvm python3 curl git golang jq python3-pip
pip3 install tqdm
```

### Build

Compile and clean up the FeatureSpy simulator as follows.

```shell
cd Simulator/simCode
# compile
make
# clean up
make clean
```

### Trace download

We provide the script to download Linux, GCC, CouchDB, and Gitlab datasets, respectively. Note that the snapshots will be downloaded to the `packed-linux`, `packed-gcc`, `packed-couch`, and `packed-gitlab` directories under the `Simulator/traceDownload` directory, respectively.

```shell
# download trace
cd Simulator/traceDownload
chmod +x *.sh

# download Linux dataset
bash downloadLinux.sh

# download GCC dataset
bash downloadGCC.sh

# download CouchDB dataset
python3 downloadCouchDB.py

# download Gitlab dataset
python3 downloadGitlabCE.py
```

For simple and quick testing, you can use the following script to download only one CouchDB snapshot for testing:

```shell
# download trace
cd Simulator/traceDownload
chmod +x *.sh

# download CouchDB sample dataset
python3 downloadCouchDBSample.py

```

### Exp#1: Trade-off study

We provide a quick way to analyze the trade-off between detection accuracy and false positive. You can use `runSnapDetection.sh` , `runSnapFalsePositive.sh` to test FeatureSpy's detection ratio and false positive under synthetic snapshots, respectively. Note that you can modify the parameters in the scripts to test different window sizes, x, y, and r (See our paper for the details of these parameters).

```txt
# test with detection ratio or false positive
cd Simulator/scripts
chmod +x *.sh
bash runSnapDetection.sh
bash runSnapFalsePositive.sh
```

For `runSnapDetection.sh`, the following messages will be output after the script is executed, including each condition's information and the detection ratio of the three schemes under that condition.

```txt
Snapshot size = 1024 MiB, fake file number (n) = 1024, modify pos (x) = 2, modify length (y) = 2
Detection ratio with 1 feature = 0.0000000000
Detection ratio with 2 feature = 0.0000000000
Detection ratio with 3 feature = 0.0000000000
...
```

For `runSnapFalsePositive.sh`, the following messages will be output after the script is executed, including each condition's information and the false positive ratio of the three schemes under that condition.

```txt
Snapshot size = 1024 MiB, swapped ratio (r) = 0.01, modify pos (x) = 2, modify length (y) = 2
Detection ratio with 1 feature = 0.0000000000
Detection ratio with 2 feature = 0.0000000000
Detection ratio with 3 feature = 0.0000000000
...
```

### Exp#2: Case study of attack detection

We provide a quick way to analyze the detection accuracy and false positive. You can use `runCouch.sh` , `runLinux.sh` , `runGCC.sh`, `runGitlab.sh` to test FeatureSpy with CouchDB, Linux, GCC, and Gitlab, respectively. In addition, you can modify the parameters in the scripts to test different window sizes. Here we use the simplest CouchDB (include only one snapshot download by `python3 downloadCouchDBSample.py` as described in the previous section) for a brief description. See [Simulator/README.md](Simulator/README.md) for the guideline for running the test with the full dataset.

**Note that the following script should only be executed when the dataset download has been completed.**

```txt
cd Simulator/scripts
chmod +x *.sh
bash runCouchSample.sh
```

In the running of the scripts, the program processes each snapshot and finally outputs the detection ratio and false positive results in the command line (via `stdout`).

```txt
---------- Results ----------
Output results:
Detection ratio with CouchDB dataset:
Detection ratio with 1 feature = 1.0000000000
Detection ratio with 2 feature = 1.0000000000
Detection ratio with 3 feature = 1.0000000000
False positive with CouchDB dataset:
Detection ratio with 1 feature = 0.0000000000
Detection ratio with 2 feature = 0.0000000000
Detection ratio with 3 feature = 0.0000000000
```

## Prototype

The FeatureSpy prototype augments the previous SGX-based encrypted deduplication system [SGXDedup](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc21/presentation/ren-yanjing) with FeatureSpy, to detect the learning-content attack in a client-side trust-execution environment.

### Prerequisites

FeatureSpy prototype is tested on a machine with a Gigabyte B460M-DS3H motherboard and an Intel i7-10700 CPU and runs Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

Before running the prototype, check if your machine supports SGX. If there is an option such as `SGX` or `Intel Software Guard Extensions` in BIOS, then enable the option; otherwise, your machine does not support SGX. We strongly recommend finding the SGX-supported device in the [SGX hardware list](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware).

### Dependencies

We now provide a one-step script to install and configure the dependencies automatically. If necessary, the script will ask for a password for `sudo` operations. We have tested the script on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

```shell
cd Prototype/
chmod +x scripts/environmentInstall.sh
./scripts/environmentInstall.sh
```

Restart is required after the installation is finished. Then, check whether both `sgx_enclave` and `sgx_provision` are in `/dev`. If they are not in the directory (i.e., the SGX driver is not successfully installed), reinstall the SGX driver manually and restart the machine until `sgx_enclave` and `sgx_provision` are in `/dev`. We strongly recommend that you refer to the instructions of [SGX Installation Guide: Download Link](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf) and [SGX SSL README: Link](https://github.com/intel/intel-sgx-ssl) during manual or automatic installation for troubleshooting.

### Configuration

FeatureSpy prototype is configured based on JSON. You can change its configuration without rebuilding it.

### Build

We provide a script for a quick build and clean-up, and you can use it.

```shell
cd Prototype/
chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
# Build FeatureSpy in release mode
./scripts/buildPrototype.sh
# Clean up build result
./scripts/cleanupPrototype.sh
```

The generated executable file and its required enclave dynamic library keys are all stored in the `bin` directory.

### Usage

You can test the prototype in a single machine and connect the key server, cloud, and client instances via the local loopback interface in `bin` directory. Since the key enclave needs to be attested by the cloud before usage, you need to start the cloud (`server-sgx`) first, then start the key server (`keymanager-sgx`), and wait for the message `KeyServerMain : key server remote attestation done, start to provide service` that indicates a successful attestation. **Currently, we have provided a set of Intel EPID-based remote attestation subscription keys for testing in `./Prototype/config.json`**

```shell
cd Prototype/
# start cloud
cd bin
./server-sgx

# start key server
cd bin
./keymanager-sgx
```

FeatureSpy prototype provides store and restores interfaces to clients.

```shell
cd Prototype/
# store file
cd bin
./client-sgx -s file

# restore file
cd bin
./client-sgx -r file
```

## Detailed Instructions

A detailed configuration of the prototype can be found in [Prototype/README.md](Prototype/README.md), and [Simulator/README.md](Simulator/README.md) for the simulator.
